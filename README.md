# Hearth
A social media UX study that utilises Axios and Firebase for back-end functionality.

You can access the project here: https://hearth-prototype.web.app/

Why did I make this?
The goal of the project was to help me understand the fundamentals Node and Axios. I focused on using Axios to talk to a Firebase database and used Material-UI to put together a quick and easy user-interface.

Responsiveness
Please note: The app is ideally mobile only. It will work on desktop but the experience less than optimal.

Browsers
For best experience use Chrome.

Credit
In this project I use React, Firebase, Axios, Material-UI and UUIDV4.
